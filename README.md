Framework including Java For Kinect Library

This is an open source work with relevant copyrights distributed within the code.

The only major changes were to modify it build with the latest JOGAMP, and to automatically manage these dependencies with maven.

The only advantage here is that the original repo location is difficult to find and does not include the aforementioned dependencies within its repo.
