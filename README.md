Framework including Java For Kinect Library (J4K)

This is an open source work with relevant copyrights distributed within the code.

The framework has been modified to build with the latest JOGAMP, and to automatically manage these dependencies with maven.

The only advantage here is that the original repo location is difficult to find and does not include the aforementioned dependencies within its repo.

The project is set up for exporting the framework as a JAR using Eclipse. 

Future changes may alter or eliminate the behavior of the built-in UI classes.
